Several thousand temporary files are generated in the process and stored in directory `scratch/`. They correspond to the fitted margins, copulas, and other data. They are not versioned in this repository for being too many, but ZIP archives are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/julian-urbano/sigir2018-simulation/releases/tag/scratch).
